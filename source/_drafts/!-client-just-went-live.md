Hey guys, just had a client go live. Interested in buying a diamond or engagement ring for your lady? Check out [http://www.edwardjamesandco.com](http://www.edwardjamesandco.com). Edward not only sells a large arrangement of engagement rings, but he has a huge selection of loose diamonds.

 

On a personal note, I’ve been working with Edward for the past 6 or so months, and he’s a really great guy. The next time I buy my wife something of this caliber I’m definitely going to be going to him.

 

Even if you’re not in the market right now, go check out the site anyway. He has a wealth of knowledge about diamonds and rings: what to look for in a diamond or setting, and other information about how the entire certification process works. He’ll be updating his site regularly to keep people informed of his industry, so if you’re into diamonds you might want to consider registering on his site just for informational reasons.

 

Anyway, that’s my two cents, take care guys!
