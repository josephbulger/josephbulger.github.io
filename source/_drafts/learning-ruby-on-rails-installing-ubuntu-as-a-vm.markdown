Installing Ubuntu as a VM is vastly simpler (and faster) than installing any Windows distro.

As an aside, I'm using VMWare's Workstation product, in case you're wondering what VM software I use, but you could do this just as easily with other products.

  1. Go to Ubuntu and grab the [latest version](http://www.ubuntu.com/download)

	
  2. Kick up a new VM

	
    1. Choose a Typical Install

	
    2. Choose to Install from disk (iso) file



	
    1. Pick the iso you just downloaded




	
  3. Run through the installation process on your VM


Once you have Ubuntu up and running it's probably going to ask you to apply some updates, but aside from that you're done!

I made a video of this whole process.
