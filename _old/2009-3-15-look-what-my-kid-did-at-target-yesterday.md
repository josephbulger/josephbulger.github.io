That’s where you see the shots of him with his mouth wide open. What you can’t see is his hand gestures. Yes, he’s actually doing poses. Kind of freaks me out a little bit. At first he was just playing around with my wife with the hat and the glasses, but then he saw me taking picture and he actually started posing.
