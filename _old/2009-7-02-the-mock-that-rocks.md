I've discovered a product that I really enjoy using and thought I would share it.<!-- more -->  It's called [Balsamiq Mockups](http://www.balsamiq.com/products/mockups) and it's a tool that you can use online or on your computer for drawing up quick ideas on software systems.  They use a sketchy kind of font to give you that "drawing out a spec" feel.  What really makes the product so appealing is how fast you can build up a simple mock to show to your team.  I'm literally able to sit down at my computer and within 5 minutes have a meaningful mockup of some kind of feature I want to convey.  Really powerful stuff.

Here's an example of the kind of thing you can build with it.
