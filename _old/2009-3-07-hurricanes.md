In case you weren't aware of this already, I'm located at the tip end of Florida in a city called Homestead.  So needless to say I'm very concerned about Hurricane forecasts!  I usually use the [National Hurricane Center](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/)'s information when tracking hurricanes, but I recently came across this other tool that does a really good job of visually presenting you the data.  The tool is called [Storm Pulse](http://www.stormpulse.com/) and it gives a Flash representation of the Atlantic Basin.  You can look at historical tracks, weather models, wind models, etc. 

 Really cool Stuff.  Check it out if you get some time.
