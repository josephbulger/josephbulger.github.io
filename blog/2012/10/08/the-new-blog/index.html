<p>So I&rsquo;ve created a new blog. It&rsquo;s built using <a href="http://nodejs.org">nodejs</a> and so far I&rsquo;m really liking it.</p>

<p>The part that I&rsquo;m really digging is that I build my articles now using markdown files, so I can write up a markdown file from basically anywhere, then upload it and voila, instantly on my blog.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also really nice to be able to modify my blog as I see fit right down to the metal.</p>

<p>And on top of all that, it&rsquo;s also a <strong>lot</strong> faster than my other blog, which was on PHP using wordpress.</p>
