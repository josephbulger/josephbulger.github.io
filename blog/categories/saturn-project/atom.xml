    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My church’s band has done this AMAZING thing by producing an album that people can buy and ALL proceeds go to helping people in Cambodia.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Specifically, this is an excerpt from their site:</p>

<blockquote><p>By purchasing this album, you will be added to this partnership and will in turn help provide clean water, build a village, build a health clinic, and create education opportunities for the people of Cambodia, Southeast Asia, and other locales.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, any one who reads this that knows me knows I wouldn’t be writing this unless it was completely legit and worth your time and effort.</p>

<p>So if you’re like me and you have a hard time trusting in organizations to do some good, but would like to know where a <strong>good place </strong>to do some charity would be, this is it.</p>

<p>If anyone has any questions feel free to contact me directly. I will be glad to spend the time talking to you and directing you to the right people.</p>

<p>Take care!</p>
