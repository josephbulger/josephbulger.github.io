    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been unexpectedly suprised by the longevity of my BlackBerry Curve.  I&rsquo;m coming up on my 2 year mark, and it&rsquo;s still operating the same as it was when I bought it.  I think that&rsquo;s the first phone I&rsquo;ve had that I can say that of.  That&rsquo;s also not for lack of use, either.  I&rsquo;ve really beat the heck out of this phone.  The only issue I&rsquo;ve come across is the ball will get sticky every now and then and it won&rsquo;t respond to movement.  There&rsquo;s a simple remedy, though.  All you have to do is move around the ball with a damp cloth.  After you&rsquo;ve done that for a bit, let it dry and you should be able to use the ball again.  I&rsquo;ve had to do this about 4 times, because my son, Isaac, get&rsquo;s a hold of the thing and get&rsquo;s some <em>funk </em>on it.</p>

<p>All in all, very pleased with my BlackBerry.</p>
