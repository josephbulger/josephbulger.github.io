    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m going to be making my family “agile” in the upcoming weeks. What does that mean exactly? Well, I’ll be posting more about it, but essentially we’re going to organize our family activities around agile principles. These are software management principles that I have been studying (and trying to apply) for a number of years now. They have proven to be very effective at my work, and I can see how they would be equally effective at home, as well.</p>

<p>So what exactly am I talking about? Let’s take a look. I’m going to start out by making a cork board for our family. It should look something like this:</p>

<p>Colored cards are “shared” cards. That means any parent can do them. Children also have a daily card. These are things they have to do every day, and they check them off when they’re done.</p>

<p>When we actually get the board I’ll post up some pics and explanation.</p>
