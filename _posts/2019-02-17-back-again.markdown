I haven't written here in a really.. REALLY.. long time, and I think it's time I fixed that.

<!-- more -->

To be honest, I stopped writing because I didn't really think I had much to say. I got to a point in my career where I felt like everything I was learning was something that everyone else already knew, or someone else was writing about it already and I couldn't really add much to the conversation.

Also, I think part of it was that I thought that the things I was doing, or learning about, weren't all that interesting, and that I had nothing else worth saying. So I kind of just stopped writing for a long time, with the idea that I really didn't have much worth saying.

I've since realized a good number of things, and I hope to write a series on this later. To get me started though, I just want to put out there that I was definitely wrong, and I did have a lot to say. I have a feeling that I wasn't focusing on the right topics, and maybe now I can revitalize what I was trying to do before.

To get me started again, I'd like to share that I was part of the AWS ReInvent conference this year. I gave a talk on [Fargate](https://youtu.be/rIfQT4ZGI3Y?t=1808) and how our teams at Turner are adopting that technology.

I won't get into the details here, but I'll be looking dive deeper into this later. For now, stay tuned.
