My church’s band has done this AMAZING thing by producing an album that people can buy and ALL proceeds go to helping people in Cambodia.

<!-- more -->

Specifically, this is an excerpt from their site: 

> By purchasing this album, you will be added to this partnership and will in turn help provide clean water, build a village, build a health clinic, and create education opportunities for the people of Cambodia, Southeast Asia, and other locales.

Now, any one who reads this that knows me knows I wouldn’t be writing this unless it was completely legit and worth your time and effort.

So if you’re like me and you have a hard time trusting in organizations to do some good, but would like to know where a **good place **to do some charity would be, this is it.

If anyone has any questions feel free to contact me directly. I will be glad to spend the time talking to you and directing you to the right people.

Take care!
