So I've created a new blog. It's built using [nodejs](http://nodejs.org) and so far I'm really liking it.

<!-- more -->

The part that I'm really digging is that I build my articles now using markdown files, so I can write up a markdown file from basically anywhere, then upload it and voila, instantly on my blog.

It's also really nice to be able to modify my blog as I see fit right down to the metal. 

And on top of all that, it's also a __lot__ faster than my other blog, which was on PHP using wordpress.
