Have you ever found yourself lost inside some sort of block statement, wondering when the beginning of the block began or ended?  I just found this awesome feature in Visual Studio that allows me to jump to the beginning or ending of a block.

To do this, put your cursor before or after the brace (your choice) and then press **Ctrl+]**. It works with either curly or round braces.

I originally found this nifty little feature from another [blog](http://vkreynin.wordpress.com/2008/07/09/jump-between-braces-in-visual-studio/)
