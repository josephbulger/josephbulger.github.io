Welcome to **JosephBulger.com**!  This is hopefully going to be the first of many blogs that I write!  This blog will focus on things that I take interest of mostly: my family, programming, various technologies, etc.

## My Family


Needless to say, this is where the majority of my time and effort are spent!  So naturally, I'll be blogging a great deal about my family.

My wonderful wife, Michelle, takes care of our entire family, which is completely unbelievable.  She's also running  a [blog.](http://www.cookingwithmichelle.com)

Sarah is just finishing up 4rth grade! 

Joseph is talking/walking/running/anything like crazy and Isaac has nearly mastered the art of walking and is moving onto the science of speaking.


## Programming


I'll be writing a lot of blogs about programming concepts and their applications that I come across in my work.


## [RockDigital Consulting](http://www.rockdigitalconsulting.com) 


I work full time as a Senior Software Engineer, but I also run a consulting company on the side that I might write about preiodically as well.  Sound like a plug?  You bet it is =P  Sorry, have to get my advertising in when I can!  Anything cool and exciting that happens to my company I'll most likely blog about so people can see what's happening there.


## Technologies


This could really be about anything, but its most likely going to be cool gadgets, ideas, frameworks I'm looking into or using.
