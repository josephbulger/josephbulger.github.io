In case you haven't noticed, a lot of my posts recently have been using [gist](https://gist.github.com/). It's an awesome tool that's freely available which allows you to write snippets of code in a variety of languages.

<!-- more -->Not only does it do that, but the actual gist that you create is a full fledged Git repository, which means you have the ability to clone it , pull and push from it.

I also use a [plug in](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/embed-github-gist/) for my blog that let's me show individual files on any of my gists.
